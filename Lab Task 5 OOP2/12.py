#Suppose you are given the following dictionary where the values are lists. dict_1 = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'b': ['1', '2'], "c": [4, 5, 6, 7]}
#Write a Python program that counts the total number of items in a dictionaryâ€™s values and prints it.
#[Without using sum(), len(), count() functions]
#Note: Make changes to the above dictionary and see if your code works properly for other dictionaries as well.

dict_1 = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'b': ['1', '2'], "c": [4, 5, 6, 7]}
