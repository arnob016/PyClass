#Fill in the blanks to make the is_power_of function return whether the number is a power of the given base. Note: base is assumed to be a positive number. Tip: for functions that return a boolean value, you can return the result of a comparison.

def is_power_of(number, base):
    # Base case: when number is smaller than base.
    if number < base:
        # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
        return number == 1
    # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
    return is_power_of(number / base, base)
